MMU - The Intelligent Home Group Project 2014/15

## Synopsis

Automation is changing the way our society works; computers have replaced tedious jobs that require little skill or 
repetitive actions. The manufacturing industry has spent millions researching automation. They have created 
fully automated product lines that require only a few members of staff to administer the process. 
Home automation is still in a stage of innovation; Multinational companies have spent lots of money 
developing systems in this field. The main goal with home automation is to free people from simple tasks 
that computers can replace.
